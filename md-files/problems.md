  Main Issues:

  1. Triple-nested duplicate functions - The scrape_website function was defined 3 times, nested inside itself (lines 6, 19, and 32). This
  2. Wrong ChromeDriver path - Used "./Google Chrome For Testing" as the driver path, which isn't a valid ChromeDriver executable path.
  ChromeDriver is a separate binary, not the Chrome browser itself.
  3. No automatic driver management - Required manual ChromeDriver installation and path configuration, which often breaks when Chrome updates.
  4. Missing error handling - The original had a basic try/finally but didn't handle common WebDriver exceptions gracefully.
  5. Browser runs visibly - No headless mode configured, so Chrome would pop up on screen each time.
  6. Excessive wait time - Had a 10-second sleep regardless of page load time.
